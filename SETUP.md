# Setup & Troubleshooting

One page to get any laptop — including a locked-down corporate one — running the
Basecamp notebooks. **The fastest reliable path is a virtual environment in VS Code.**

---

## The 4-command setup (do this once)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv                 # create an isolated environment
source .venv/bin/activate             # macOS/Linux  (Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt       # install everything the exercises need
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # your key (Windows PowerShell: $env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-...")
```

**On Amazon Bedrock instead of the Anthropic API?** Same four commands, but set these
two in place of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — see "Using an Amazon Bedrock key" below:

```bash
export AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=...   # your Bedrock API key
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1           # the region your models are enabled in
```

Then open any `.ipynb` in VS Code and **select the `.venv` interpreter as the kernel**
(see "Wrong kernel" below). Run the first cell — you should see `✓ Dependencies ready`
followed by `✓ API key verified`.

> The venv isn't optional anymore — every notebook now refuses to run on a bare system
> Python (see "Why the notebook just stopped" below). It's still the one setup that
> sidesteps *every* problem on this page at once.

## Why the notebook just stopped

Every notebook checks — at the top of the same cell that installs packages, so the
check can't be skipped by running cells out of order — whether it's running inside an
isolated environment (a `.venv` or a conda env). If it isn't, the cell stops before
any install happens, with:

> ⛔ This notebook is running on your SYSTEM Python, not an isolated environment...

**This is expected and intentional** — it replaces the old behavior where the setup
cell would quietly fall back to installing into whatever Python the kernel happened
to be (including, in the worst case, `--break-system-packages` against your system
install). On a personal laptop that's merely messy; on a corporate-managed machine
it can mean an IT ticket. The guard catches this *before* any install happens instead
of after.

**Fix:** do the venv setup at the top of this page, then pick that `.venv` interpreter
in the kernel picker — see "Wrong kernel selected" below. Using conda instead of venv?
`conda activate <your-env-name>` (not `base`) satisfies the same check.

**Already have everything installed globally, on purpose (facilitator demo box,
self-managed system Python)?** Set `BASECAMP_ALLOW_SYSTEM_PYTHON=1` in your shell
before launching VS Code/Jupyter to bypass the check for that session. This is an
intentional escape hatch for people who know what they're doing — don't hand this
out as a default fix to a participant who's actually hit the corporate-IT case above.

## Using an Amazon Bedrock key

The exercises run on either an Anthropic API key or an Amazon Bedrock key — the setup
cell detects which one you have and connects accordingly. You don't change any exercise
code; only the credentials differ.

Put **both** of these in your `.env` (or export them in your shell), and comment out or
delete the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` line:

```
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=paste-your-key-here
AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK=<your Bedrock API key>
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

`AWS_REGION` is required — Bedrock has no default. Use the region your Claude models are
enabled in. When it connects you'll see a green banner naming the provider and region:
**"✓ Bedrock key verified (us-east-1) — you're connected to Claude as
anthropic.claude-sonnet-5."**

Two things to know:

- **Model access is per account *and* per region.** A valid key can still fail with
  "model isn't available to you in `<region>`" — that means the model isn't enabled for
  your account there. Enable it in the Bedrock console under **Model access**, or switch
  `AWS_REGION` to a region where it is. The setup cell checks this up front so you find
  out at setup rather than four cells later.
- **Model IDs differ.** Bedrock prefixes them (`anthropic.claude-sonnet-5`); the
  Anthropic API uses the bare ID (`claude-sonnet-5`). The notebooks handle this for you
  via the `MODEL` / `FAST_MODEL` / `BIG_MODEL` variables the setup cell defines — use
  those rather than hardcoding an ID, and your code runs on both.

**If both credentials are set, the Anthropic API key wins.** To force the Bedrock path,
unset or comment out `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

**One exercise differs on Bedrock:** Day 2's Inference Optimization demonstrates the
Batch API, which is an Anthropic API endpoint that Bedrock doesn't expose. The notebook
detects this, builds and shows the batch requests, and skips only the live submission —
the cost model that follows is the actual teaching point and is unaffected. (Bedrock has
its own batch-inference product with a different API.)

## Common problems

### `error: externally-managed-environment` (PEP 668)
**Why:** you're installing into a system Python (Homebrew on macOS, or the OS Python on
Debian/Ubuntu) that's marked off-limits for `pip`. **Fix:** usually nothing — the setup
cell detects a locked-down Python and installs into your user space automatically on the
**first** run, printing just `✓ Dependencies ready` (no PEP 668 wall of text). Prefer not
to touch the system Python at all? Use the venv above; it's the cleanest path. You'll only
get a message if **every** install strategy fails — an offline machine or a blocked PyPI
(see the proxy section below).

### Wrong kernel selected (the most common VS Code trap)
A notebook can run against a different Python than your terminal — so your `pip install`
lands somewhere the notebook can't see. **Fix:** in an open notebook, click the kernel
name (top-right) → **Select Another Kernel → Python Environments** → pick the one ending
in `.venv`. If you don't see it, run **Developer: Reload Window** and look again.

### No admin rights / `permission denied` on install
A venv is owned by you, so it needs no admin rights — use it. If you can't make one, the
notebook's automatic `--user` fallback installs into your home directory instead.

### Corporate proxy / PyPI blocked by the firewall
Point pip at your proxy, then install:
```bash
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://user:pass@proxy.company.com:8080
export HTTP_PROXY=$HTTPS_PROXY
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If PyPI itself is blocked, ask IT for your internal package mirror and use it:
`pip install -r requirements.txt --index-url https://<your-mirror>/simple`.

### "I don't have Python" / wrong version
You need **Python 3.10+**. Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
or your company's software portal, then re-open VS Code so it's detected. Check with
`python3 --version`.

### API key
The setup cell creates a gitignored **`.env` file** the first time you run it — never paste
your key into a notebook cell. Open the `.env`, paste your key after `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=`,
save, and re-run the cell. The key never touches the notebook, and it survives kernel
restarts so you paste it once. A single `.env` at the repo root serves every exercise (the
cell walks up the folders to find it). You can also set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your shell —
it wins over the file — and if neither is set, the cell shows a hidden input box as a
fallback. A key starts with `sk-ant-`.

## Still stuck?
Run the first cell and read the message — the install and key-check cells print a specific
next step rather than a raw traceback. If it points you back here, the venv path at the top
resolves it in the large majority of cases.
